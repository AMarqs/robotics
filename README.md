# ROBOTICS

I started my journey on robotics during my studies on the university. I ended it with my thesis about [Autonomous Tracking](https://github.com/AMarqs/Bachelors_Thesis).

This repository is an index of the projects I'm doing on robotics.

I will also include the theory and fundamentals I learn about robotics and applied mathematics.
